Some words about the game...
----------------------------
Shrink shift was made with MelonJS (Thanks to Olivier Biot for this awesome framework). Feel free to discover MelonJS on [melonjs.org](http://melonjs.org/)!
The theme of the game was Minimalist and we decided to make a Puzzle-Game. We made an entire new movement system to do so.
Feel free to use the code or ask something, juste leave a comment.
