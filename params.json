Feel free to discover MelonJS on [melonjs.org](http://melonjs.org/)!\r\nThe theme of the game was Minimalist and we decided to make a Puzzle-Game. We made an entire new movement system to do so.\r\nFeel free to use the code or ask something, juste leave a comment.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n- Developpement : Demurgos & Halfman\r\n- Graphism : Azopi\r\n- Music : Lykan\r\n- Level Design : Cabra\r\n\r\nTools used\r\n----------\r\n- Code :\r\n  - Halfman : Visual Studio 2012\r\n  - Demurgos : Komodo Edit\r\n- Music :\r\n  - Cubase\r\n- Graphism :\r\n  - Paint.NET\r\n  - PhotoShop\r\n  - Gimp\r\n- Level Edit :\r\n  - Tiled\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
